Loading screens made by me (CS Eden) with carefully handpicked screenshots taken in game with Grokitach's G.A.M.M.A. Modpack graphical setup which includes notably:
- Gardener of the Zone (by YuriVernadsky)
https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/gardener-of-the-zone
- Simple Autumn Retexture No leaves (by Daedalus-Prime)
https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/simple-autumn-retexture-no-leaves
as well as G.A.M.M.A.'s Weathers.

All assets used in this addon are the entire property of these authors, I only made the screenshots
and edited them to become loading screens. All screens are higher resolutions than vanilla and will
not impact perfomances whatsoever. The format Linear BC7 was used for optimal quality & size compression.

If you're seeing any issues, please report it to me so I can work on fixing it as soon as possible.
Enjoy.
